The project was written in Ruby programming language. Normally I use MacOS but this time I was coding on Windows. In order to run this project on Windows:

1. Install Ruby 2.7.1 (WITHOUT DEVKIT!) https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
2. Type gem install bundler in CMD (after ruby installation)
3. Type bundle install in the project directory
4. To run the project type ruby main.rb
5. To run tests type rspec . 

Tips for Unix-like users:
1. Install RVM (Ruby version manager) and Ruby version 2.7.1 (I didn't use any new features but still I used this version but you may as well use some older ones).
2. Install bundler - gem install bundler
3. Run bundle install in the project directory to install Rspec testing framework
4. To run the project type ruby main.rb (interpret the main.rb file)
5. To run tests type rspec .
